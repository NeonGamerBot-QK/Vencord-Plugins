## My Vencord plugins

</div>

<!--These can be installed by following the guide [here](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/blob/main/docs/1_INSTALLING.md) -->
### Install 
> [!TIP]
> There's also [this video by Syncxv](https://youtu.be/8wexjSo8fNw) which shows how to install a userplugin on Windows.  
> Just be sure to replace the `git clone` command with the one from below

Clone the repository inside your Vencord `src/userplugins` folder (create the folder if it doesn't exist)
```bash
cd Vencord/src/userplugins
git clone https://github.com/NeonGamerBot-QK/vencord-plugins Neon-plugins
pnpm build
````
